Week 4 Homework Assignment
The psuedocode is as follows:
create variables to hold the following values:
varRandomGenerator for the random number from 19 to 120 that is selected for the user to guess
varRandomCrystalAmount for the amount that the user gets added to userAggregate each time clicked.
varUserAggregate to hold the total of the user points from clicking
A comparison of the UserAggregate to the RandomGenerated number
The logic to declare winner if userAggregate is equal to the RandomGenerator number
declare loser if the number exceeds the RandomGenerator
let user play again if the number (userAggregate) is less than the RandomGenerator
Start the game again and reset all values.
